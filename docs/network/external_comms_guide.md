## General information

### Background

In this document, you will find information related to communication and organization of the Trustlines Network ecosystem. The purpose of this document is to provide clarity around the different entities and concepts that make up the Trustlines Network and to be a tool that you can use for arranging meetups or otherwise expanding the Trustlines Network ecosystem.
If you are interested in **starting a community currency, arranging meetups, using Trustlines for local economic empowerment**, this document is for you!

### The Trustlines Network

The Trustlines Network ecosystem describes the ecosystem of individuals, projects, and entities aligned toward the idea of mapping trust-based relationships on to trustless infrastructure. Sometimes this is also simply referred to as the Trustlines Network. No single entity owns, is, or can be, in charge of this construct.

### The Trustlines Protocol

The Trustlines Protocol represents a set of rules, processes, and definitions forged into deployable code, which aims to enable the mapping of trust-based relationships on to trustless infrastructure, e.g. a blockchain.

More specifically, the Trustlines Protocol implementation will include the components used to calculate paths and store transactions:

  - The Trustlines Blockchain, which is a mPoS (minimal viable Proof of Stake) sidechain to Ethereum and stores transactions 

  - The relay servers, which calculate the optimal paths and relay the transactions sent by applications they are connected to

  - The client library, a high-level API, which enables applications to interact with the smart contract system on the Trustlines Blockchain via the relay servers

  - The smart contract system which includes the currency networks and other smart contacts supporting currency network related transactions, e.g. identity contract(s)

### Trustlines Access

Trustlines Access describes the technology stack that enables convenient access to use the Trustlines Protocol implementation. This can comprise of end-user facing apps and the operation of the relay servers.

Entities are supposed to run business models under this brand. If they do, they need to license the trademark “Trustlines” from the Trustlines Foundation.

### Entities

#### Trustlines Stiftung/Foundation

The Trustlines Stiftung (Foundation) was set up to support the protocol development for the Trustlines Network.

The mission of the Trustlines Foundation is to pursue the charitable goal of promoting the financial and economic inclusion of all people through decentralized peer-to-peer network protocols that serve common accounting.

The Trustlines Foundation is supporting research, development, deployment, governance, and adoption of the Trustlines Protocol, with a focus on acting in a supporting role within the Trustlines Network enabling different decentralized p2p use cases.

**The Foundation is/does:**

  - Supporting (financially and in-kind) research, development, and governance of the Trustlines Protocol while being unbiased about specific use cases

  - Support the adoption of the Trustlines Protocol even in specific use cases to the extent that these do not conflict with its charitable purpose

    - To that end, it's specifically organizing and promoting open-source development around the Trustlines Protocol and maintaining respective Github repositories

  - Incentivising and supporting developers or other entities that want to build on top of the Trustlines Protocol

    - For example, for the use case, people powered money: community currency projects

    - The foundation does this in a purely educational, nonprofit way

  - In charge of maintaining the "Trustlines" and "Trustlines Network" names/trademarks and related domains

  - Deploy needed core components, e.g. smart contracts, which support the Trustlines Protocol

  - Has ownership over the Trustlines brand and trademark

**The Foundation isn't/doesn't:**

  - Own the Trustlines Network ecosystem, it only owns the trademarks!

  - Own the Trustlines Protocol related code; everything is open-source licensed

  - Targeting or providing access to end-users

  - Related to brainbot group or its subsidiaries

#### Brainbot Technologies

brainbot technologies AG is a software development company operating in the blockchain space, focusing on core blockchain technology. It offers its services to third parties outside of, and inside, the brainbot group. In the context of Trustlines, brainbot technologies conducted a feasibility study for an early internal testing version of the Trustlines Network protocol and a mobile app that lets its users interact with the Trustlines Protocol. The mobile app is being developed by Auxiliary GmbH. Also, brainbot is continuing to contribute to the open-source software of the Trustlines Foundation.

#### Auxiliary GmbH

Auxiliary GmbH is a new entity under the brainbot group umbrella. It aims to provide infrastructure services and develop, as well as potentially operate, components that provide access to decentralized networks. Examples for this:

  - UI/Front-ends/Apps to interact with blockchain data, e.g. the mobile application
  - Relay servers to facilitate easier access to blockchain data
  - Blockchain nodes

In the Trustlines Network ecosystem context, Auxiliary aims to develop and deploy an app and potentially other components providing access to the Trustlines Network, most probably within the German regulatory framework.


## Resources

These resources should help you dive deeper into the world of Trustlines. There are also items to help you with presenting Trustlines to an audience and images to use concerning Trustlines.

The official brand names in the Trustlines ecosystem follow a specified pattern of capitalization. These would be the trademarked names as well as other related brand names. The brand names are capitalized when used in a context in relation to the brand being used. When referring to the general technology or other aspects that aren’t in direct connection being used regarding the brand, the words aren’t capitalized.

Examples of capitalizing brand names would be Trustlines **N**etwork, Trustlines **P**rotocol, and Trustlines **B**lockchain. So if you are generally referring to the blockchain or the associated technology, capitalization isn’t used. Or when referring to a protocol other than the Trustlines Protocol. And a networking event about the Trustlines Network would have a lowercase network used.

## Arranging a Meetup

Anyone is free to arrange a meetup related to the Trustlines Network. If you are interested in making a Trustlines Meetup here’s a list of resources that may be of use.

### Organizational

  - There are [Brand Guidelines](../brand_guidelines.html) for color schemes and logos you can put on any website related to the meetup - please read and respect the guidelines!
  - You can send an email to the Trustlines Foundation for a slidedeck explaining Trustlines.
  - You can send an email to the Trustlines Foundation to check if it can help find a speaker for a meetup.
  - You can check the [Trustlines Foundation’s Twitter account](https://twitter.com/trustlinesfound) to see when the next meetup is planned.

### Topic ideas

Trustlines covers a broad area both technically and sociologically speaking. Listed below are a few topic ideas that may be of interest.

  - Trustlines Protocol and People Powered Money - An overview of the most essential components of the Trustlines Protocol and an in depth look at blockchain based credit issued mutually amongst trusting friends often times referred to as “People Powered Money” (PPM).

## Promoting Trustlines

## Use cases of the Trustlines Protocol

As a fully open source protocol, any individual or organization is free to develop use cases for the Trustlines Protocol.

Currently, one of the more established and well developed use cases is people-powered money.

### People-Powered Money (PPM)

The Trustlines Network supports the creation of blockchain-based peer-to-peer currency networks. In dense societal networks and due to the transitive nature of financial relationships, one could imagine a plethora of financial use cases that utilize these networks. Leading among them would be the ability to engage in economic transactions that could be viewed as a substitute for general payments of all kinds. This twist, i.e. the transition from a credit registry towards a system that could be used to facilitate payment-like transactions, is comparable to the principles of LETS-systems or, for example, the unofficial financial network "Hawala".

### Others

A plethora of other use cases is being discussed by the community, such as financing of SMEs, non-financial use cases, or even using Trustlines as an “operating system” for a more traditional banking system.
